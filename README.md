# Zahra Abassi - Data Analysis Portfolio

## **About**

**Hi, I'm Zahra!**

I'm a data engineer with a software engineering degree, specializing in Business Intelligence (BI) and data analytics. My journey into the world of data began in 2019 with a data bootcamp, igniting my fascination with its potential to unlock valuable insights.

My first experience witnessing the power of data came when I built and monitored a social media data pipeline. I designed tables to capture user profiles, posts, comments, likes, and more, enabling me to analyze user engagement, sentiment, and social media trends. This project solidified my belief in the power of data to drive informed decision-making.
